Here is a list of books I am working on self studying. Some might link to an
entire repository, others have notes / summary for each chapter.
* k&r

* Computer Power and Human Reasoning
** introduction
Ok. My mind is kinda blown. Weizenbaum said a bunch of stuff and I'm still
digesting it.
- he made eliza
- people have faith in science
- and this is not much different to theater, pepole must assume that magic is
  being done
- people don't understand how computers work
