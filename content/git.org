Today marks my first day in an experiment i'm conducting on myself. The goal is
to spend at least one hour every day involved in learning about git. Before
starting this, I have done some collecting of sources, and some reading of how
to use git. My abilities with git are good enough for keeping configuration
repositories between my desktop and my laptop, but I still am barely grasping
how git works internally.

** [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2][pro git]]
Still I have to read through;

- Distributed Git
- GitHub
- Git Tools
- Customizing Git
- Git and Other Systems
- Git Internals

** [[https://gitexercises.fracz.com/][git exercises]]
I started this a while ago but still need to finish them. I think I could go
through them all again.
** TIL about git shortlog
This feature is awesome, you can use it to easily see how many commits people
are making to a repository. With the command
#+begin_src sh
git shortlog -ns
#+end_src
you are able to see who has committed the most to a repository. Here is the
output of that command on the git repo;
#+begin_example
 27457  Junio C Hamano
  4611  Jeff King
  2390  Johannes Schindelin
  1945  Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason
  1824  Nguyễn Thái Ngọc Duy
  1810  Patrick Steinhardt
  1401  Shawn O. Pearce
  1314  René Scharfe
  1203  Elijah Newren
  1118  Linus Torvalds
   954  Michael Haggerty
   902  brian m. carlson
#+end_example
Fascinating. Junio C Hamano is legendary!

These notes are meant to serve as a roadmap for people that come after me, and
are looking to learn enough to be useful and contribute to git.

Understanding c thoroughly is important. Treat this as a sacred text.
** [[https://bitbucket.org/jacobstopak/baby-git][baby-git]]
Understanding gits initial commit is something that you are able to do much
easier than reading the current entire codebase.
** [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2][pro git book]]
Read this so that you can start learning everything about git. Treat this as one
of your sacred texts.
** [[https://git.github.io/GSoC-Participants/][past git GSoC contributors]]
This is a great resource, it might make sense to review previous work done in
order to familiarize oneself with the process.
** [[https://git.github.io/][git developer pages]]
Use these pages to get a grip on contributing to git.
** [[https://public-inbox.org/git/?q=%23leftoverbits][#leftoverbits]]
Search for this in the mailing list to find potential things you can do.

The GSoC applications for 2025 were due in February.
